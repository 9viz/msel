 msel
======

select multiple items in a tui and echo it to stdout/file

note:
     if the number of options exceeds your terminal's LINES
     var or if there are a LOT of options, you will not have
     a fun time selecting things since the ui sucks right now.
     all the tui libs I tried were too bare or didn't work in
     musl because proc-macro doesn't compile in musl :(

to install, you need cargo and make.
    make
    make clean install

if you don't want to use make, then run
    cargo install --path ./

 controls
==========

the controls are simple. a vi-like and emacs-like controls
are offered.

j/C-n      => down
k/C-p      => up
space      => select
esc/C-c/q  => exit
g/M-<      => go to first option
G/M->      => go to last option

 flags
=======

usage: msel [OPTIONS] text...
options:
    -h              print this help message and exit
    -d              change the output delimiter
    -f              change the output file path (default stdout)
